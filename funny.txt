this is a test file for git
i will write things now but might change them later

what will i change? i do not know. 

i suppose i could just write more. that isn't particularly exciting, but such is life. 

beep beep beep. no one is listening. Beep Beep Beep! even louder still. BEEP BEEP BEEP. Oh, there. It seems that one did it. 

i will pretend nobody saw me scream. moving along. *whistling discreetly*

this made more sense before i reverted to the version without the BOLD FACED TYPE

this is being edited online. how wonderful! let's hope the network works for a while...

now i'm changing it locally. ta daaaaa
