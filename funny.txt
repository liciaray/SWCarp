this is a test file for git
i will write things now but might change them later

what will i change? i do not know. 

i suppose i could just write more. that isn't particularly exciting, but such is life. 

beep beep beep

i will pretend nobody saw me scream. moving along. *whistling discreetly*

this is being edited online. how wonderful! let's hope the network works for a while...

now i'm changing it locally. ta daaaaa
